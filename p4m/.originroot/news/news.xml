        title="Papyrus Classic and Desktop">
        <p>
            Hello Everyone, most of you would have already seen it but, just to broadcast it to the largest amount of people possible : the latest 6.7.0 release of Papyrus should be the last official release based on GMF diagrams and XWT property views. We are not planning to maintain a regular release schedule for this version now refered as Papyrus-Classic and available on the <a href="https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus-classic">Eclipse Gitlab</a>.
            The next version is already under development and will be contain major updates and its frameworks. Its diagrams will be based on the Eclipse Sirius diagram framework, its property view on EEF and the ElementTypes framework will gradually be replaced with the DomainService framework in charge of the UML editions.
            This 7.0.0 release is planned to be released aroung the 2024-12 GA. More information can be found on this <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1115544/">forum post</a>.
            For this reason, we might have to rework the current update sites and releases references under the usual <a href="https://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/papyrus/">Eclipse download server</a>. We will make sure to keep you informed when this is happening, via both these news and the forum.

            It is now possible to associate model explorer customizations to the architecture framework.
            Papyrus now requires Java 11 to run along with the 2020-12 eclipse releases and has trimmed down the number of re-exported bundles.
            Note that most of the 'relatives': Sysml 1.4, 1.6, Moka, designer... have also been made compatible with the new re-exports and the Java 11 migration.

            We will now begin to work on the next major release of Papyrus (5.0.0) in order to allow us some API changes and other corrections. This version will be available in time to integrate the 2020-12 release train.
            Because we need to focus on this goal, there is no release planned for the 2020-09 train.
            The 5.0.0 release will contain, for example, the refactoring of some dependencies such as removing the reexports wherever possible and removing deprecated APIs lingering for far too long in the code base.
            We will inform you about any work undertaken on the wiki page <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Papyrus/2020.12_Work_Description">Incoming work for 2020-12</a>.
